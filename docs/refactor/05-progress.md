# Refactor Progress

## 2026-04-09

### Completed in this run

- Created the mandatory `docs/refactor/` handoff and planning set:
  - `00-system-overview.md`
  - `01-problem-analysis.md`
  - `02-target-architecture.md`
  - `03-refactor-plan.md`
  - `04-risk-register.md`
  - `05-progress.md`
  - `06-next-steps.md`
  - `07-decisions.md`
  - `08-todo-global.md`
- Analyzed the current repository structure and identified the main monoliths and risk areas.
- Documented the target modular architecture and the incremental migration strategy.
- Removed `AGENTS.md` from `.gitignore` so the central control document is no longer implicitly excluded.
- Updated repository validation to require `AGENTS.md` and the `docs/refactor/` files.
- Updated source packaging to include `AGENTS.md`.
- Started Phase 2 with a first Proxmox UI seam extraction:
  - added `proxmox-ui/beagle-ui-common.js`
  - moved config/token/URL helper logic behind a dedicated runtime asset
  - updated `scripts/install-proxmox-ui-integration.sh` to install and load the extra asset
  - updated validation to syntax-check the new file
- Continued Phase 2 with additional module extraction:
  - added `proxmox-ui/api-client/beagle-api.js`
  - added `proxmox-ui/state/installer-eligibility.js`
  - reduced `proxmox-ui/beagle-ui.js` further to delegated bootstrap/wrapper behavior for API and state concerns
  - updated Proxmox UI installation to load the additional runtime assets in order
- Continued Phase 2 again with feature-specific API seams:
  - added `proxmox-ui/provisioning/api.js`
  - added `proxmox-ui/usb/api.js`
  - moved provisioning and installer-prep credential API wrappers out of `beagle-ui.js`
- Added the first `proxmox-ui/utils/` module:
  - `proxmox-ui/utils/browser-actions.js`
  - moved basic error/toast/open/download browser actions out of `beagle-ui.js`
- Started extracting USB-specific UI state handling:
  - added `proxmox-ui/usb/ui.js`
  - moved installer-prep banner/button/state update helpers out of `beagle-ui.js`
- Started `components/` extraction:
  - added `proxmox-ui/components/ui-helpers.js`
  - added `proxmox-ui/components/desktop-overlay.js`
  - moved generic HTML helpers and the desktop wallpaper overlay renderer out of `beagle-ui.js`
- Introduced the first provider-neutral architecture seam for browser-side logic:
  - added `core/provider/registry.js`
  - added `core/virtualization/service.js`
  - added `core/platform/service.js`
  - added `providers/proxmox/virtualization-provider.js`
  - rewired `proxmox-ui/state/installer-eligibility.js` to use the new platform service
  - moved `proxmox-ui/beagle-ui.js` inventory/profile/fleet loading paths onto generic virtualization/platform services instead of direct `/api2/json` usage
  - updated Proxmox UI installation, validation, and source packaging to include the new `core/` and `providers/` assets
- Continued the architecture handoff and rule set for provider-neutral work:
  - updated `AGENTS.md` to make provider-neutrality and `09-provider-abstraction.md` part of the mandatory continuation flow
  - updated refactor docs to describe `core/` and `providers/` as first-class repo surfaces
  - extended the risk register with the incomplete-provider-abstraction risk
  - aligned general architecture/security/install docs so Proxmox is described as the current provider, not as the permanent architecture center

### Current phase assessment

- Phase 0 Analysis: completed as a baseline
- Phase 1 Target architecture: completed as a baseline
- Phase 2 Proxmox UI refactor: advanced from helper extraction to dedicated profile/fleet component modules plus the first aligned browser-extension seam
- Provider abstraction groundwork: wired into the Proxmox UI, the browser extension, and a first host-side control-plane helper
- Provider-neutral documentation and continuation rules: aligned with the new architecture baseline
- Phase 3 onward: not yet implemented structurally, except for process guardrails

### What is not done yet

- Only the first runtime-preserving code extraction has happened inside `proxmox-host/`; `thin-client-assistant/` and `beagle-kiosk/` still have not been modularized.
- `proxmox-ui/` now has `common`, `api-client`, `state`, `provisioning`, `usb`, `utils`, and larger `components` seams including `profile-modal.js` and `fleet-modal.js`. `beagle-ui.js` dropped from roughly 2500+ lines to about 1760 lines, but provisioning result/create flows still keep a large orchestration block there.
- `extension/content.js` no longer performs raw `/api2/json` or Beagle API token/config plumbing itself, but it is still a large UI/rendering monolith with local profile synthesis logic.
- `proxmox-host/bin/beagle-control-plane.py` now delegates VM inventory, node inventory, VM config lookup, next-VMID allocation, storage inventory, and guest IPv4 lookup into `proxmox-host/providers/proxmox_host_provider.py`, but provisioning mutations and guest-exec flows still call `qm`/`pvesh` directly.
- No new behavioral tests or smoke tests have been added yet.
- No release deployment work has been done in this run.

### Known risks after this run

- The large monoliths still exist.
- `proxmox-ui/beagle-ui.js` is materially smaller, but the Ubuntu desktop create/edit modal and provisioning result window are still substantial inline UI blocks.
- Frontend token handling still exists as documented.
- The new provider abstraction now covers the Proxmox UI, the browser extension, and the first host-side read path; host-side write paths, script-side calls, and installer-side provider neutrality are still pending.
- Local `.build/` and `dist/` directories still exist and should not be treated as authoritative release outputs.
